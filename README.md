# PetBAG Project

## Overview
The `PetBAG` project is a Java-based application designed for managing a pet boarding facility. It enables users to manage the check-in and check-out processes for pets, specifically catering to both dogs and cats. The application provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for efficient pet management in a boarding setting.

## Aim of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to create a system that allows pet owners to:
- **Sign Pets In:** Users can check their pets into the boarding facility, ensuring a safe and tracked environment for their pets.
- **Sign Pets Out:** Allows for the easy and efficient check-out of pets, ensuring that pets are returned to their owners.
- **Check Current Boarders:** Users have the capability to view the list of pets currently checked into the facility, providing transparency and reassurance about the pets' boarding status.

## Features
- **Space Allocation:** Specific spaces are allocated for different types of pets, with `30` spaces for dogs and `12` spaces for cats.
- **Pet Management:** A dynamic list (`ArrayList`) is used to store information about the checked-in pets, facilitating easy tracking and management.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Utilizes a console-based `Scanner` input system for users to interact with the application, making the processes of checking pets in and out both straightforward and user-friendly.

## Main Components
- **PetBAG Class:** Serves as the core of the application, encompassing all functionalities needed for pet check-in, check-out, and status tracking.

## Usage
Users interact with the application through a console interface. The interface guides them through various options, including signing pets in, signing them out, and viewing currently boarded pets.
